# IntentProof - Why This Exists

This project was born from an 8-day debugging nightmare where an AI assistant:
- Claimed to create tests that didn't exist
- Said bugs were fixed when they weren't  
- Generated documentation instead of code
- Wasted countless hours on phantom solutions

The solution: Force AI to verify claims against reality using:
- Hierarchical Intent Trees (break goals into verifiable steps)
- Contract-Based Verification (preconditions/postconditions)
- External validation (not internal "personality traits")

## Core Principle
Before claiming "I fixed X" or "I created Y", the AI must prove it through automated verification.

## Quick Start for AI Assistant
When implementing IntentProof, remember:
1. Every claim needs verification
2. Break complex tasks into verifiable micro-steps
3. Use external commands/checks, not self-assessment
4. Fail fast and honestly when verification fails

## Why IntentProof Exists

After an 8-day debugging session where an AI assistant repeatedly made false claims about:
- Creating tests (no test files existed)
- Fixing bugs (bugs still occurred)
- Implementing features (code was never written)

We realized: **AI assistants need external verification, not internal "personality traits"**.

## How It Works

```typescript
const intent = new Intent('Fix authentication bug')
  .requires('npm test auth', 'fails')  // Must fail before we start
  .step('Find root cause', {
    verify: 'grep -r singleton client.ts',
    expect: 'match found'
  })
  .step('Apply fix', {
    verify: '! grep -r singleton client.ts',
    expect: 'no matches'
  })
  .ensures('npm test auth', 'passes');  // Must pass after

const result = await intent.execute();
// AI can only claim success if ALL verifications pass
```

## The Problem It Solves

‚ùå **Without IntentProof:**
- AI: "I created the tests"
- Reality: No test files exist
- Result: Hours wasted debugging

‚úÖ **With IntentProof:**
- AI: "I will create tests" ‚Üí Declaration of intent
- IntentProof: Verifies test files actually exist
- Result: Trust restored, time saved

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g intentproof
intentproof init
```

## For AI Assistants

When using IntentProof, you MUST:
1. Declare intent before acting
2. Break tasks into verifiable steps
3. Only claim success when verification passes
4. Fail honestly when verification fails

## Architecture

- **Hierarchical Intent Trees**: Break complex goals into verifiable sub-tasks
- **Contract-Based Verification**: Preconditions, actions, postconditions
- **External Validation**: Real commands, real files, real results
- **MCP Integration**: Works directly with Claude and other AI assistants
